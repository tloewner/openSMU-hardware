openSMU Hardware Repository

### Organization
This repository contains everything related to the hardware development of the openSMU project. This includes calculation, simulations, schematics and PCB/gerber files. Schematics and PCB layout is done with KiCAD, simulations with LTSpice.<br />
Submodules will be designed in a pre-development phase, before being incorporated into a functioning SMU. This allows to fix serious problems on a smaller scale and helps with keeping everything organized. Planned are three submodules: Frontend, Power Supplies and Control/Interface.<br />
At the moment, there are the following folders:<br />
+ **components_predev**: Contains Schematics/PCBs of submodules
  + **frontend**: Output Stage, V/I Measurement, DA/AD Conversion

### Currently workin on:
Layout of the frontend predev PCB is done:<br />

Build mostly finished, testing.

### Documentation
Will be available at some point, when i get around to it. 

### Why?
This is purely for fun, and because i'd like an SMU - don't count on anything.
